/*
  # Create user profiles table

  1. New Tables
    - `profiles`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key, references auth.users)
      - `email` (text, unique, not null)
      - `avatar_url` (text, nullable)
      - `created_at` (timestamptz, default now())
      - `updated_at` (timestamptz, default now())

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `profiles` table
    - Add policy for users to read their own profile
    - Add policy for users to update their own profile
    - Add policy for users to insert their own profile during registration

  3. Storage
    - Create `avatars` bucket for storing user avatar images
    - Enable public access for avatars bucket
